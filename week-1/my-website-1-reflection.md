Open Source means the code for a piece of software is available for anyone to view, and additionally the software itself can be distributed, used or modified free of charge. Some restrictions may be place on the conditions under which the software can be used for free, depending on the open source license applied.

Open source is absolutely critical to the workings of the internet as we know and I believe it's a really important element to building the distributed web of trust that must exist for a free and open internet to function. Open source makes software a public asset that is owned, maintained and for the benefit of the people. While companies or individuals with profit motive may contribute to and use open source software, they can't take it out of the public domain which leads to much greater usage and impact on the common good. 

Open source liceneses are important as they give the creater(s) of the software some control over how and under which conditions it may be used. This is important to incentivize release to the public of things which may have commercial value without losing all possibility of monetizing the work. 

The end to end flow of creating a repository, pulling it down to the local machine, creating a new branch to make some changes, committing the changes and the merging back in to the master branch were really solidified with this exercise. 

I used a Google Search for "what is open source" https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=what%20is%20open%20source to answer that part of this reflection.
