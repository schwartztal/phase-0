      <h1>Git Control to Major Tom</h1>

    <p>
      As Week 1 of Dev Bootcamp Phase 0 is drawing to an end, I find myself thinking about how much I've learned already and how that barely scratches the surface of what's to come. The good thing is I feel comfortable in the fundamentals that we've spent most of the week focused on: interfacing through the command line and the basics of code version control. Version control is near and dear to my heart from a previous life as a mechanical engineer designing complex downhole (in the well) oil production equipment, but it takes on a whole new meaning when applied to software. If you'll bear with me for a few minutes, I'd like to expound on the virtues of git and GitHub. 
    </p>
 <h3> Git it</h3>
    <p>
        Whether working by yourself or collaborating with others, a version control system is a valuable tool for keeping track of the most recent iteration of code that's been written along with a history of changes made along the way. Like save points in a video game, if you make a mistake you can roll back to a previous "known-good" state and try again. This can save hours of frustrating time spent hunting down where that one extra space was introduced that brought everything to a grinding halt. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Git is the version control system we'll be using through DBC and it brings a couple of cool features to the table when compared to other options out there like SVN. First and foremost, each instance of Git is a fully formed and functional repository. Whether you're connected and working online with the central repository or on a beach somewhere with no hope of a data connection, with Git you can keep working without any fear of getting hopelessly out of sync. Next, Git plays nice with a remote repository when you do get back online and makes the check-in and rationalization process pretty painless. Finally, Git keeps track of each commit with a unique hash which includes details about the heritage of that commit which makes it easy to keep track of where a particular set of changes originated and easy to roll back if needed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Add GitHub to the mix and you've got a pretty great system for collaboration with others locally and remotely, in your timezone or halfway around the world. As a cloud based solution that speaks seamlessly to the local Git instance on your machine, you get the benefit of cloud (always available, copies stored remotely for DR,  asynhcronous collaboration) with the ability to work when and where it's convenient for you, checking code back in on your own schedule. 
    </p>
<p>
      Another benefit of GitHub is the ease of use as a portfolio of work and a demonstration of progression in the learning experience when it comes time to find a job.  By keeping track of our work along the way, it'll provide a great starting point for pulling together examples of solo and collaborative development that prove to potential employeers that we can DO, not just talk.

         <h1>The Benefits of Control</h1>
         <h4>October 4, 2015</h4>
         <section>
             <p>Version control is like living for today and not giving up the past. Version control is when each of us gets our own way, and the group stays happy. Version control is being in two places at once.</p>
      <p>As if that wasn't crystal clear, let's add that version control is how developer teams all stay on top of the game, even when people are doing their own thing. It allows individuals to work on a project without slowing down or affecting the work of others. It allows bugs to be quickly identified and isolated. It allows people in different places to work at their speed and in disparate directions, while still pushing toward the same goal. It allows great minds to work at their best, without the technology getting in the way.</p>
      <h2>Ch-ch-changes</h2>
      <p>We all want to believe that the longer we work on something, the better it should be. Working on complicated systems like computer programs can show us that's not always true. If I spend all morning writing code to improve something on the right side, I will be crushed to see that my changes also succeeded in breaking something on the left. Ugh. With git, that disappointment should last only as long as it takes me to compare the latest code to my last commit, and isolate the problem.</p>
      <p>Any person who has used "track changes" in Word will be blown away by the visual display of changes on Github. It's so clear to see how text was added here, or removed here, as well as to have access to the informative justifications that are often included in each commit. This is especially important when my team members are far away. I don't have to make a long phone call to another time zone to learn what my colleague did and why. Github will show me, instantly. And if I realize that all those changes I did this morning are for naught? Well I can roll back to my previous commit, and pretend none of that ever happened. That's the best part of tracking changes with version control.</p>
