Solution to Drawer Debugger challenge in drawer_debugger.rb

What concepts did you review or learn in this challenge?

I completed the Drawer Debugger exercise: https://devbootcamp.instructure.com/courses/11/assignments/632?module_item_id=3970. It reviewed errors from Ruby and tracking down where those issues are in the code, then correcting them.

What is still confusing to you about Ruby?

Nothing at the moment, guess it's time to go learn some new concepts or get more practice.

What are you going to study to get more prepared for Phase 1?

Practice with syntax for Ruby and Javasript, my biggest weakness at the moment is correctly typing in code what I can think up in my head.
