<!-- 
Translating the previous learning with HTML into an actual site was a little bit challenging but the elements were pretty straightforward. Adopting the HTML5 semantics was also pretty easy, as I hadn't spent any time really getting used to <div> and the new main, section, article tags are more intuitive to use. 

We managed to stick to the no formatting in HTML even though it made our page look pretty ugly, definitely looking forward to learning and including CSS next week to understand how it transforms the raw content and structure into something pretty. 

My peer pairing partner Ryan had a good trick about remembering how to write HTML in that as he descirbed it HTML tags are pretty much exactly what you'd expect for the action you're trying to take. In that they're either the first letter of the word, an abbreviation or the word itself. That worked really well for the tags we used in this exercise and I'll be paying attention over the next few weeks to see how well that rule of thumb scales.
