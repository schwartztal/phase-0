<h2> Day 1</h2>
<h3> The 6 Phases of Web Design</h3>
<p>
	
	According to Selene M. Bowlby of iDesign Studios the phases of web design are :

	<ol type="1">
		<li>Information Gathering</li>
		<li>Planning</li>
		<li>Design</li>
		<li>Development</li>
		<li>Testing and Delivery</li>
		<li>Maintenance</li>
	</ol>
</p>
<h3> Planning </h3>
<p>
	Now that I've got some resources pulled together for my website, I need to start thinking about the purpose of the site, how I want people to consume or interact with it and then how I'm going to lay out the structure and where all of the elements will fit together to make it a great experience for users.

</p>

<h4> Purpose </h4>
<p>
	The primary goal for my first site is to serve as an introduction of myself and my work to the world. I'll be using this as a portfolio for prospective employers, but also send it to friends and family who are interest in finding out more about my experience in DBC and how I've been spending a few months of my life.  
</p>

<h4> Target Audience </h4>
<p>
	 This site is aimed at people who want to know more about me! This breaks down into two main camps: people who are considering employing / working with / working for me and my friends / family. The first category of users are likely to be highly technical and short on time. For them I want to make the relevant information on work experience, portfolio highlighting my skills and contact info easy to find. Friends and Family are likely to be less technical and more interested in exploring the process of how I've learned, not just looking for the end results that prove what I've learned. They'll be more interested in the written content of reflection and introspection.  For ease of reference, I'll lump these two primary groups of users into "Professional" and "Personal"
</p>

<h4> Actions </h4>
<p>
	When users hit my site I'll want them to be easily able to:<br>
	Professional  - find the portfolio, see the resume/work experience, interact with an example site, contact me through e-mail or LinkedIn<br>
	Personal - read my thoughts about the experience, browse &amp; click through examples of my work, post their thoughts or otherwise interact with me
</p>

<h3> Design and User Experience</h3>
<p>
	For new developers, the main things to know about design and user experience are that they determine how people (users) actually interact with your site and to a large extent define how much they'll take away from the experience. You may have written an exceptionally architected example of a complex application, but if the user can't find and interact with it in a quick and easy manner, they'll either A) leave or abandon the site or B) stick with it but take away a perception of poor quality.
</p>
<p>
	Since the User Experience (UX for short) determines so much about how we consume and consequently feel about a site, it's important to integrate UX insights and design principles from an early stage. This is a wide field of knowledge and growing rapidly but the most important insight is that designing for what you think is 'cool' or what others <i> say </i> is important will only get you part of the way. It's key to observe empirically how people actually use sites and test some design options (A/B testing) to validate that your chosen design actually drives the desired behavior.
