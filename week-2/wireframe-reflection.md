# 2.4 Wireframing
## Reflection

A wireframe is a simple visual representation of the elements of a web page laid out as they'll appear in the final production page, but stripped down to the basics. Like a sketch before a painting is created, it gives developers and designers (not to mention clients) a quick to create and easy to modify preview of what the site will look like. This emphasis on quick and easy is important for iterative approach to design where feedback is solicited and changes are made frequently, without investing too much time into any one version. 

Although I typically don't have much interest or skill in the visual or aesthetic side of design and product, I enjoyed this initial round of wire-framing my own personal site. Watching something go from 0%  to 10% complete is always a fascinating experience for me, and the similarity to drafting in mechanical engineering is pleasing. 

I iterated through a few wireframes on paper very quickly before settling on a design that I felt would work well enough to invest the time to wireframe in Balsamiq. After using the tool, I would skip the pen and paper step and just jam through ideas on the Balsamiq app. It's intuitive to build and make changes, and the clone tool came in really handy for keeping the two wireframes similiar in their basis but different enough to accomodate their unique purpose (landing page vs blog content)
