What did you learn about the DOM?
The DOM is a really useful way to refer to elements in an HTML page, and with Javascript change properties of those elements.
What are some useful methods to use to manipulate the DOM?
The ones I really want to write down and remember are the core ways to refer to / find elemnts on the page:
document.getElementById (returns a single element)
document.getElementsByClassName ( the rest of these return a NodeList, basically an array)
document.getElementsByName
document.getElementsByTagName
